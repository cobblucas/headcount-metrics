**Description:** This project employs visualizations, including AI-driven smart narratives, pie charts, and bar graphs, to offer insights into the evolution of employee headcount over time. The dataset consolidates information from various sources, presenting coherent time-series data on headcount over time. To examine individual departments, users can utilize the slicers located towards the top of each page.

The analysis delves into employee diversity and insights across multiple pages, incorporating pie charts and tabular data matrices. These visual representations illustrate a headcount by gender, age group and nationality.

Additionally, the project conducts a detailed examination of attrition, distinguishing between division and department, with a specific emphasis on headcount by tenure and showcases key influences on attrition.

Lastly, the focus shifts to attrition trends, exploring headcount by attrition status. The analysis also considers headcount by year and date hired.
